The final iteration of the Jurassic Park software, developed in Java8 and JavaFX. 
Made for UTSA Spring2019 Applications Programming. Showcases, most importantly, implementation of multi-threading and file I/O
within Java8 and JavaFX.

The application allows the user to see the list of dinosaurs located in each zone of Jurassic Park.  The information is held in text files that, through the application, can be modified to reflect a change in a dinosaur's location.  The application also represents each zone with a slideshow of dinosaurs at that location, which utilizes basic multithreading.

Utilizes: Java, JavaFX
